**Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**
----The client was The Gaming Room. They wanted to create a software application, based on their existing game "Draw It or Lose It", that would run on PC and mobile devices.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
----I believe I correctly evaluated the different strengths and weaknesses of the development tools present on each operating platform - Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**
----We did not fully code the application, but I found working through the UML diagram to be a huge benefit. Visualizing how the software works before diving into code is a smart practice.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
----I would like to further flesh out the design constraints. I would like to include specific options that fulfill each design constraint.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
----I incorporated various security designs, such as key derivation functions, to help protect the user. This isn't the only user need to consider, but it is an ever important one.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**
----I think identifying design constraints and building the UML diagram were great early steps in the design process. This helped visualize the fundamental process of the aplication, along with considerations that may not reveal themselves immediately.
